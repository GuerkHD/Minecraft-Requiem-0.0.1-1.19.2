This mod adds two things.

1. A new ore which ties in to the food system, by being edible, making other things edible and introducing tools, realated to hunger and food.
2. The possibility to optain and use a small selection of stand abilitys from the popular animanga series JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.

These both tie in together, because the stands use food and hunger as their main resources for their abilities. The new ore and it's corresponding items help with that. 

I created this mod as a fun little add-on to a modpack I'm going to play with friends and to start to learning modding in general. Don't take it to serious.
